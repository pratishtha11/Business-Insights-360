# **AtliQ Business Insights 360**

## **Project Overview**

**AtliQ Hardware** is a fast-growing company expanding globally. It specializes in selling computers and accessories through three key sales channels: **retailers**, **direct sales**, and **distributors**. 

Despite its impressive growth, the company experienced unexpected losses after opening a store in the United States. These setbacks were initially identified through basic surveys, intuition, and rudimentary Excel analysis. As its competitors leveraged advanced analytics teams, AtliQ recognized the importance of improving its own data analytics capabilities.

To address this, **AtliQ Hardware** decided to implement **Power BI** to support decision-making through data-driven insights across multiple business functions, such as **finance**, **sales**, **marketing**, **supply chain** and  **Executive**.

In this project, I followed the **Codebasics Power BI Course** to learn Power BI fundamentals and apply them to real-world business data.

## **Datasets**

The datasets used in this project are crucial for generating insights that can drive business decisions. Two main types of data tables were used:

### **1. Dimension Tables** (Static Data)
These tables contain fixed information that helps to categorize and describe facts:

- **dim_customer**: Contains customer details, such as name, location, and other demographic information.
- **dim_market**: Provides data about different market regions and segments.
- **dim_product**: Includes details on the products offered by AtliQ Hardware.

### **2. Fact Tables** (Transactional Data)
These tables represent business transactions and metrics:

- **fact_forecast_monthly**: Forecasts the quantity of products that customers will need in the future. This is used to optimize inventory levels and warehouse storage, leading to **higher customer satisfaction** and **reduced storage costs**.
- **fact_sales_monthly**: Similar to the forecast table but captures actual sales dataâ€”used to compare against forecasts for performance evaluation.

Additionally, data from **gdb056** included more specific financials:

- **freight_cost**: The transportation costs associated with product delivery.
- **gross_price**: The sales price of products before deductions.
- **manufacturing_cost**: The cost of manufacturing products.
- **Pre_invoice_deductions**: Discounts applied before invoicing.
- **Post_invoice_deductions**: Discounts applied after invoicing.

## **Data Importing and Data Modeling**

### **Why Data Modeling is Essential**

Data modeling is a fundamental step in the analytics process. It involves structuring the data so that it can be efficiently queried and visualized. Without proper data modeling, analysis can be inaccurate and difficult to scale.

**Steps in Data Analysis:**
1. **Data Extraction**: Collecting data from various sources (in this case, MySQL).
2. **Data Cleaning**: Preparing data by removing inconsistencies and irrelevant entries.
3. **Data Modeling**: Creating relationships between tables to enable efficient querying and reporting.
4. **Data Analysis**: Using the structured data to generate meaningful insights.

In this project, the **Snowflake schema** was employed, which is a normalized method of organizing data that helps reduce redundancy and improve query performance.
